	<h1>Magic realism</h1>
<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Not to be confused with science fantasy.</p>

<p>Magical realism, magic realism, or marvelous realism is a genre of narrative fiction and, more broadly, art (literature, painting, film, theatre, etc.) that, while encompassing a range of subtly different concepts, expresses a primarily realistic view of the real world while also adding or revealing magical elements. It is sometimes called fabulism, in reference to the conventions of fables, myths, and allegory. <em>"Magical realism",</em> perhaps the most common term, often refers to fiction and literature in particular,[1]:1-5 with magic or the supernatural presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane setting.</p>

<p>The terms are broadly descriptive rather than critically rigorous. Matthew Strecher defines magic realism as <cite class="quote">"what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe".</cite>[2] Many writers are categorized as "magical realists", which confuses the term and its wide definition.[3] Magical realism is often associated with Latin American literature, particularly authors including genre founders Miguel Angel Asturias, Jorge Luis Borges, Elena Garro, Juan Rulfo, Rómulo Gallegos, Gabriel García Márquez and Isabel Allende. In English literature, its chief exponents include Salman Rushdie, Alice Hoffman, and Nick Joaquin.</p>
